INPUT/OUTPUT

1. Write a script that propt the user to give two integer numbers (int) and prints
   how many numbers between them exist, such that the remainder of their division
   by 5 is 0. Example: in the range (14, 25) there are 3 such numbers: 15, 20 and 25.
  *There are two approaches for solving the problem:
     -first approach: use mathematical tricks for optimized calculation based on the
      fact that every fifth number is divisible by 5. Think how to implement this
      correctly and about the borderline cases.  
     -the second approach is easier but it works slower: with a for-loop each number
      within the given range can be checked. You should read in Internet or in the
      chapter "Loops" how to use for-loops.*

2. Write a script that prompts the user to write an integer number n. After that
   prompts n numbers from the console and prints their sum.
  *You can use prompt().*

3. Write a script that reads an integer number n from the console and prints all
   numbers in the range [1 - n], each on a separate line.
  *Use prompt and for loop.*

4. Write a script that prints on the console the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci
   sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ...
  *More about the Fibonacci sequence can be found in Wikipedia at:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence. For the solution of the problem
   use 2 temporary variables in which store the last 2 calculated values and with
   a loop calculate the rest (each subsequent number in the sequence is a sum of
   the last two). Use a for-loop to implement the repeating logic (see the chapter
   "Loops").*
